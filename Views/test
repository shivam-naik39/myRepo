Actual yes, yes starting yes
recording started yeah I'm sharing my screen. Yeah we can
see your screen. So today I was going to give you demo both
these user management utility WP1. So PX is he this is the main
thing for all the utilities who can have some access or some
admin rights for all the utilities like view, copy type,
system, compare whatever. So for that we need to have these user
management utility for for that all. So first of all I logged in
with Super admin user see we have two different logins. One is like the administrator
login, one is for development. So if you click on this
administrator login, it will be going for the username and
password which is pxs admin. It is super admin guy. So for this
super admin user he can able to see all the pxs utilities as
well as some configurations and everything. So if I'm trying to
log in with. This is development so this is
this is nothing but some non admin users. For example I'm I'm
one of the Elm user so if I'm trying to log in here so it will
ask for Elm credentials. For example if I give my login yeah
my nxf ID so it will take to the Elm login and as well as it will
go it will redirect to the pxs. So I'm the non I mean nonadmin
user. So for me see can you see I don't have any utilities I are
able to see. I'm just able to see whatever that PX is
developed about version and all. So these and all are these
environment. Currently we are doing this dev right so that's
why it is showing us development. If you log in with
the test QA or something it will show that your environment
details accordingly. So I will provide. So we need to
log in with pxs admin, super admin user. So in in the general
tab go to this user management utility. So here we can able to
create some groups. OK so for example if I'm trying
to create some groups, see this is the group we can have create
groups. So here we have 4-5 different roles. This is for pxs
role. These and all for Elm process roles, DN roles etm
ewmgc roles. So first we will talk about these pxs roles. So
create any group name, give any group name for example. For my user ID for my Anusha
user ID I'm giving some pxs utilities for example. So for
for to utilize that utilities see here we have two things
itilities roles and Elm manager. Itilities is all the things
whatever we have attribute mapping, linked attributes,
type, system, compare, update. These user management view, copy
we can able to see. For example I want to give some
user management utility only access only access role. I'm
providing add and close to my user ID. So here we can able to
search non admin users. I'm providing my user ID here and
I'm able to create the group. So after creating the group. The sync should happen. Sync is
nothing but like if any group was created automatically sync
will happen and it will show like in progress or pending or
completed. So currently it is in completed state. So let me log
into the another browser here through another browser I'm
accessing this pxs. Development already I was logged
into the Elm application with my user ID, so that's why it is
directly navigate with my user credentials to the pxs
application. Previously I'm just able to see only about section,
now I'm able to see this user management utility OK, but here
see we have. Here we have the synchronize all
settings icon everything. But for here we don't have anything.
Why? Because I have only user management utility access role.
I don't have any right? So that I don't able to see that the
synchronize all button, settings button and everything. So for
example here if I'm trying to create some group. For non admin users who have
only access rights means they are not able to see this pxs
role icon only. They can able to see these four icons. Elm
process roles only and here also we cannot see any project area.
See there are it is showing no options. I will tell you why.
See. So this is because we have only access rights that's why
I'm not able to create any group or do some actions. Now again I'm going back to the
another browser with this pxs admin guy. So already I created
group right? So I'm just going to update that group. Here we
have edit option. If I click on edit same pxs role we have one
more thing. This is Elm manager role for one minute. I will show
you one thing. See here they clearly mention
allow a user to create, edit, delete or do some sync
operations of any group. If any project or team area they have
corresponding Elm manager roles. So to do some access also we
should have this Elm manager role mandatory. For example I'm
taking these are the same thing etm. What are the project areas
we have in DM, etm, GC, ewm. All the project areas will load
here. So I'm selecting DN application. From here I'm
selecting any project area. For example I'm selecting this Mig
RT4 okay. Add and select update. Now I
just given some Elm manager role only Okay initially it will in
in pending and it will go for update and later on it will go
for completed status. Now if I log in again back to the my own
nxf ID to pxs just refreshing the page. See in DM I should able to see
that project area only. Why? Because even though I have
access right I have this project area admin right. So now now
onwards these Anusha user will be acting as a admin for this
Mig Route 4 project area. Even though he was an she was an
access right she have. But this for this particular
project area she will act as an admin. So now I can able to
create groups by using this this DN roles as something. If I
provide for the ETM or GC or something then then I can able
to see those project areas also here OK see now I'm able to see
that group name also here but I cannot able to edit it. Why? Because it is showing I
don't have user management admin role. I have only access right?
Right that's why it is showing. If I have some admin right then
I can able to edit this group as well as from my own pxf ID. Now
now I'm removing this access right? Actually to create any group,
group name and any role, single role is mandatory. Without user
any single role is mandatory to create a group. So now I removed
all the roles that's why it is showing update was in disable
mode. For example now I'm selecting this user management
utility. So now I have admin rights admin means I have full
read and write access for the these user management utilities. Update see now I'm able to see
the synchronize all button, settings icon, everything so and
all the groups also. Now I'm able to visible because I am the
person who is the admin for this particular utility. These are
that pxs roles difference. Let me go back to the same group
and remove this. Without any utilities, if I give
only Elm manager also I can't see any. I will show you see I
just given only Elm manager role in the group. I didn't provide
any pxs roles. Then if I log in back to the here say my nxfid to
the pxs application, see I can't able to see any utility because
I don't have any utility access or admin rights. So itility access their admin
rights is mandatory to for a non admin user to utilize it. OK I'm
going back here. So now I will show you what is the use of that
DM roles, ATM roles and ewm roles. OK, in add group for example
select this create some group name. Here I'm selecting Elm DN
roles. I'm not sure user. So group name I'm provided. So
for example I select this project area, check clm, Elm
these. So these are the process roles. These process roles are
coming from the Elm application. OK, you know all the process
roles right? For example if you log into any here in El. Sorry,
in the DN application I'm just showing some project areas. See. In this manage project area we
have these process roles right? These process roles only. Here
it is loading. Are you able to understand? Yes I'm not sure. OK
these process roles only we are able to see here. So for that
I'm just giving some process roles to my user ID same. One second, this is DN role.
Check cm. Previously if you see I don't have this project area
itself. OK, OK, I don't have that project area now. I was
providing this process roles to my user ID and I'm creating the
group. OK OK it was created and sync
also completed. It is showing. So if I go to the DN application
I was log in with my own ID. So I'm just checking see now I'm
able to see this check CMR. So if I click on this, go to that
manage project area, see now I'm able to see only these three
process roles. OK for example again in edit
mode. Now why I'm able to edit this group means because I only
created this group. So now I have all the rights for this
particular group. I can able to delete. I mean to I can able to
archive this group. I can able to edit, I can able to add some
other users for example. Now I'm adding other user for example
let me add Shiva name. Shiva Ghosh OK Shiva name I'm
adding. So for this particular project area now on which Shiva
also will get one of the member, he will also will get added here
right? The sync is not happened still. It is showing completed. Now let
me check previously we have only two Elm functional admin and
Anusha NAV. Yes Shiva name also should get added along with
these three process roles. OK NAV in edit mode for the same
project area. So what I will do just I want to
remove some some process roles. I don't want this commenter or
administrator. So for this on this both the users I want only
administrator role. For example I'm removing author and
commenter process roles only administrator was there. Sync was completed. Let me check
in the DN project role. If you refresh the page see only I'm
able to see now administrator the two remaining process roles
was not there. And one more action we can do here if any
group contains for example. Please DN application same same
project area. Maybe these process roles are not there but
only default role is there. OK removing this administrator role
but I'm giving only default role. See now I'm able to see only in
the members. My name and Shiva name was there but there was
number process roles. Why? Because this Elm application
itself it is holdings that default role. So that's why it
won't show this default process roles like that but it will
have. But my name and Shiva name will
be added in the project area only. And one more thing we have
we can able to inactive the group. This is the inactive
button. So delete icon if you delete. If you inactive any
group group was queued for archival OK. So if it is
archived means my name and Shiva name should get removed from
this project area. See now I'm it is showing. I don't have any access to this
project area and how to get that inactive list. Means in the grid
screen same grid screen we have active and inactive groups. If
you go to the inactive group again we can able to see if you
want again we can make it as active. Here active button is
there if you click on that active icon that check box we
can able to make it as active again. Sometimes we need to refresh the
page because there is some performance issue Anusha. So if
I want to give separate user role. Only to you not for Shiva. So
right now we it has only default value. I want you I want your
account to be as an as author role or administrator role. So
that I need to create new group and add your ID there same in
the same the thing if you want for the same project area you
can give right all the process roles only for you. Only for my user ID you can have
the we can remove the users, we can add multiple users, we can
remove multiple users, remove multiple users, see no. Then now
I remove Shiva got it only. So initially name is there. So if I
go back again to the same project area sync is not
completed. I think OK your name was there. Yeah, yeah, my name was there. I
just removed Shiva name from the group. See from this group from
this project area, Shiva name I removed, only my name is there.
So if I just refresh the page again, I think Shiva name was
not there. Yeah, only my. Yeah yeah I got this. But in Pxs user
management, I want you and Shiva both to have. Admin role then we can provide
same way, same way through the pxs admin, super admin user go
to the Super admin user in the same group, same group. In edit
we can add multiple users so that those users also will have
access and along with this these applic I mean project area
right. If you want to give admin then
same thing will happen. But currently we don't have other
user credentials right? That's why I'm not able to show. You
can add if I add Shiva's name if he logins with his own nxf ID.
OK let me try with Elm functional admin right I have. 70775 I has I have this user ID,
password. So for example if I add these user he's also now he
was acting as an A non admin user update. Okay again we need
to check one more thing that user should not be in any other
group. For example now in the user search this is the search
bar. I'm just searching with the TLM functional admin user ID. 775 So he was already there in
some group. OK we need to check he have see he have already user
management access and along with this these project areas let me
log in with the LM functional admin user. Now log out from
this nxf ID my nxf ID. So if if already some Elm
application was login with my ID means if I click on login
directly it will navigate to my user ID only. So first of all I
need to log out from the Elm application from my user ID so
we'll log out. Nxf 70775 now I'm log in with
Nxf 70. In this profile I'm seeing see OK if I go to why he
was able to see these many groups means? Why he can able to see these
many groups means because he have multiple project area
access amplm all these three the He have may be other groups can
contain these project areas access. See these one group cel
amplm I'm showing if you click on these icon no it will show
you what are the roles process roles are Elm process roles
whatever that project area or. The access roles all it will
show. Why it is showing because I don't have admin role. See it
has this project area and if you click on these icon it it will
show you all the users list whatever that users are there in
the particular group it will show no users in this group. Now
you understand? Are you able to understand
there's still confusion? Ohh OK I'm oldest yeah I'm able to
understand because these groups why it is showing means because
in other group he have 2-3 extra projects are there. So whatever
that project area containing some groups are there it will
show in add group. If I see I can able to see now. See this project areas this is
Etm project area. Let me check to etm role etm see so whatever
that project areas these these are only process roles. And one
more thing all like if you create any group without pxs
utility access or admin rights whatever. If you give only Elm process
roles to some users means it will only we have that access
for the TLM application only. We cannot see able to see any
utilities in our own pxs application. OK if you give
utility access along with Elm manager then only we can able to
see. If you give utility admin rights then only we can able to
see all the itilities. Okay, okay. Got it. Yeah, this
is what about normal process functionality. Now let me go
back to the Super admin user. Okay. Now we have one more
thing. Let me show you the settings icon. Okay. My user I'm removing. I'm
removing access rights to my user ID. Yeah, I'm sure. Go a
little, go a bit slow okay, sure, sure. Sorry yeah. So now I just removed from the
group. I just removed utility access. OK, so that's why I'm
not able to say anything now. For example if any super admin
user go to settings icon here we have one more pxs. Icon What it is showing any
authenticated user for this particular environment will have
the specified roles by default. So if I provide now up to now I
have shown you this user management right? Just for
example I'm selecting view, copy utility, admin rights, add and
close. OK just click on update now. Again I'm going back to non
admin user means my user ID just refresh the pxs application see
now I'm able to see view copy and I am in the admin for this
view copy utility. So it is not related to the user specific.
They clearly mention in the settings button itself see. If any user, any authenticated
user for this particular environment who are all the
nonadmin users, if I give some access rights or something, some
utility rights means all that people all will get or these
utility rights. OK, now I'm again removing. So we have only
two rights, one is access and admin, correct? For pxs we have
only two rights for access. If you want to utilize we need Elm
manager also only access, we can't do anything. OK, so if we have admin rights
on the user management utility but we have commentator role in
Elm project that OK that is we can Elm application is
completely different vishma. So where Elm application we can
able to see that project area and that member along with that
process roles that's it. In the pxs wise I'm telling if
we have only access then we can we can't able to do anything.
Elm process roles only applicable for the Elm
applications only. Particular Elm applications only
understood. I need to see how that works. Okay. So can I show you one group with
only with the LM process role? Yes yes yes, yes please. OK, now
I just removed in the settings icon. I just removed that view
copy utility. OK again I'm updating. If I go back again to
my own ID previously I have view copyright. I cannot able to see any utility
in the pxs application. I'm just talking about Pxs application.
I'm not talking about yeah not talking about Elm. Okay. Now if
I go back again super admin guy same some project area. See
already we created some project area, right? This is the group
already I created. Okay yeah some default role I
have given and I given my ID but I I didn't select any pxs role.
That's why in my own application own nxf ID. In Pxs application
I'm not able to see any utilities okay, okay. But in the
project area in the project area I can able to see this project
area with my Member was added only. This is the difference. This is only applicable for Elm
application. It if you want some project area access for example
in the Elm application then we need to provide accordingly the
process roles team areas also. Now here for example if I
created some team area, there is no member here OK. Okay, now I'm going back to the
Super admin user. Super admin user pxs admin just refresh the
page in the same group. In the same group I'm just giving team
area access also from a user OK list that OK select team area. It will show you the team area
name. This is also same thing. It will show you all the process
roles. If I want to give some process roles I can add and if I
click on update same sync should happen. It is in pending. Let me
go to edit mode. Yeah it is completed. Now if I go to same DN
application to my user ID, if I refresh the page see now I'm
able to see my name along with the same process roles again.
Same thing if you remove any process roles here it just
remove here if I remove see for this group I'm just removing my
name. I'm removing my name. This process also roles are not was
there but I removed my name. From the group from the Pxs
group long use application. I know it's little bit confused.
Sync will be completed again if I go back to the DN application.
See now I don't have any access because my user ID was removed
from the pxs groups. So that's why I can't be able to
see. That's right, yeah, yeah. So that's why I'm not able to
see that particular project area. Okay. Then can you go back
to the pxs, okay, yes to the. Yeah, that's the project area,
right. That correct. Can you give the utility? If I give you some utility, OK,
let's take user management only access and view copy also. I'm
just showing you view copy access. I'm not selecting Elm.
Don't confuse, Elm manager role is different. Elm process roles
are different. I didn't select Elm manager role, I only
selected process roles and utility access. And you can I select my user
only? Yeah I'm selecting my user. So now again what will
happen in the Elm applications. In the Elm DN application I can
able to see that particular project area, this check cm,
whatever I don't want you to check. I don't want you to check
check cm but the other the same project that you were. OK that right project area I'm
able to access in Elm application and as well as if I
go back to the Pxs application now I'm able to see only this
user management utility and view copy. But in the add group it
should not show. Why it is showing check cm on the check cm
you have access I guess. No, no, no, no. I think maybe in
another group we need to check. Maybe in another group. If it is
there means it will come. Check. Yeah, one more group is there.
Here it is. I have given. Wait, I just remove it. I'm removing that Elm manager
role because to create any group I told any pxs role is mandatory
right? So for that simply I just added some utility, I just
can't. Can't you remove that you that pxs role just remove that
PSS role from that group in another group, right? Yeah, the yeah, this group can
you remove. See, to create any group, at least one single role
should be mandatory. So that's why I'm just adding for for to
to keep this group active. That's why I just added that
name. That's it. But I'm not adding if we remove everything
so the group will not be active, correct. It automatically deleted or not.
It not active. We cannot able to update the group. See this
update button itself will be in disable mode. So to create any
group name, create or edit group name or at least one role is
mandatory. Now I'm selecting again. See now I'm able to see update
button. If I remove group name. Group name is required, it is
mandatory. Update button will be indesirable. If you click on
cancel, it won't do any action, it will just cancel from the
group itself. Again I'm going back there same group name
Anusha this P Access utilities group name see nothing, changes
will not happen. But I just removed. Previously I
just removed my user right? It is showing like that no users
was not there. In this particular group there is only
this role. Okay again going back to the my user my user ID to Elm
I mean pxs application. Sorry see now I'm not able to see
anything in view copy utility also. User management in Add group. If
I see I can't say anything. Why? Because I have Elm process
roles. Elm process roles means it only will get reflecting the
Elm application. Even though I have the utility access, I can't
do anything. Utility access along with Elm manager role only
we are able to do some action. Okay, got it. Elm Manager role along with Pxs
role means we are the admin for that particular project area for
the pxs side, pxs application side. OK, now again I'm going
back to the Super admin user pxs admin, this settings icon. Click
on that settings icon. Now we have LDAP configurations here. OK, these are there are some
toggle buttons are there for create user, archive user, LDAP,
group enforcement and all these are the LDAP configuration
settings. These configuration settings was already done by our
development team. So currently these host details and all they
only added and these are currently it was taken from the
UAT LDAP. I think yes so these LDAP connections was connection
from the. Uat UAT database. OK, so that's
why if that LDAP connection was there in any add group, for
example LDAP groups we have users same project area will
take because. Just for some process roles I'm
giving here we have some. See these are all the you can
see the difference, right? See this icon was showing itself. It
is as an A group some group. OK, for example if I select this
test management group, what does mean? Means? Maybe for example
here for in this place there is a only testing team. Testing
team might contains Shiva. My name, Amsha name and Sushma
name maybe we three are the part of this LDAP group. Then if I
select this particular LDAP group name here means who and
all have access to this particular LDAP group, they will
can display. See for example I just creating the group, I'm
just creating the group wait. Previously, this LDAP group in
PA Pxs is managed, yes. By whom? These LDAP groups are managing
by these mxp team only, actually. So Mamata, you know
right? She's the one actually, if you want to. Add some persons into this
particular group. If you want to remove some Members from this
particular group. If you provide some mail to her she will do.
From the back end we don't have we cannot see anything. From the
UI part. Now I can't see what are the members are staying
there. Also I can't say from the help of Mamata only we can we
can able to do the testing. Actually we are dependent on NXP
team okay now currently. This completed. Let me go to
that project area CM check that project area OK. Let me go to
Team area only. OK. I have given project agenda OK previously if
you can see only my name and Ulm functional right previously if
you remember yeah. Yeah. Now able to see Arun Jain,
Satya Devarakonda and Vikas. OK, OK. These three persons are the
members of this test management group. These test management
group contains these three persons Arun Jain, Satya Vikas.
So that's why these both administrator and author what
whatever we have given these two process roles. These two process roles are
getting added. But for example maybe next time this Arun Jain
was removed, maybe Sushma name only get added into this
particular group. Means next time then automatic not
automatically. Already this group was created right already.
Now this group was created sync also happened today's date was
third. OK, on this particular date sync
was happened, test management group sync was happened and that
three members was added to the project area. Maybe tomorrow
Arun Jain was removed just removing from that group. I'm
not telling R Kevin these Arun Jain person might be removed
from the group, new person might be added, might be Sushma has
been came to the test management group, then what should happen? If you click on the synchronize
all button the synchronize all the synchronize all will what
will it will do means it will do. It will place all the groups
one by one. It starts syncing see all the groups went into the
pending, pending or something. OK it won't do for the failed.
If any anything sync was something happened then it will
go for failed status. So initially it was failing. Now
currently most of the cases we are not facing this failed
state, failed sync status. It will only concentrate on the
whatever that completed was there. It will all one by one.
One by one it will start syncing and it will do complete all the
groups. OK. So after doing this action if I click on the
synchronize all button right what we'll do now it will take
the latest data from the DB. So in the DB what will happen?
Arun Jain was removed, Sushma K was added. So that tune Arun
Jain should get removed. Here only Sushma K name should come
here. Sushma Satya Vikas Sony should get come here.
Understand. Are you able to? Yeah can I can I specifically
remove only one person from? But the project but not from the
LDAP group. From the LDAP group only. But we can't directly. We
can't do through the pxs application through UY part. I
can't do from the back end only. We can do from back end only
with the help of Mamata. If you give provide some details for
example we are sending some mails to Mamata. Sorry. Actually we need to send send
Mamata like there's some details okay what are the that host name
we are using? What are the server details we are connecting
and all. And if you want to provide please can you make just
now I have given some other details. If you want to add her
help like just add some member into that you need to provide
this group name we are using what is that? Where is that?
Sorry fix as admin. Extra set min sorry yes these
group name we need to provide test management group can you
add we need to provide that nxfid, username and can you
remove these members from the LDAP group means she will do
from the back end once she was confirmed. If you do from the
front end. If you do these actions means it should happen. So currently I can't show you
without mamata's help. So so Rekha suggested me to tell you
guys verbally this should happen here also same thing in the
group if you remove any process roles for example now only
administrator I'm selecting author I'm removing update for
the same members but the the same 3 members.  Dev is OK. But test environment
was compared to Dev. It was very slow. OK now it is showing
completed status in this group. It is having only administrator
role. If I login, go back to the DN application, same project
area, check CM enable. See now I'm able to see only
after role I'm not able to see that sorry administrator role
I'm not able to see that author role it was removed and from the
pxs admin, super admin guy if I removed from the group itself.
If I remove this LDAP group click on update. Sync was completed. So if I go
back to the project area, if I see now that Arun Jain Satya
Vikas names was went because they are not part of this
project area. That's why understood at least it. Yes, I did OK in the same thing.
See we have one more thing these are if it is this is one more
thing LDAP group enforcement. It was clearly shown if it is
enable group can contain an LDAP group or. Specific users, but not both, so
we can disable this. So OK, let me enable only if it is these
double button was enable LDAP group enforcement double button
was enable means for example if any group I must just for dummy
group I'm just creating. Simply some project area I'm
selecting. If I try to search my name and you see and they told
clearly NXP people in Dev and test, we can use utilize only
these AAC ryme groups only because. We don't know which group
contains which members. That's why they told for testing
purpose we can utilize these groups only. So currently if you
want some Members in test management group already we I
have told right. I added with the help of Mamata. We added the
three names OK if I'm trying to add this LDAP group and name see
it is showing ad enforcement is enabled. A group can contains users or
LDAP groups but not both simultaneously. So a group
cannot be created now OK it just removing see with any only user
or if I remove user only group it can be acceptable anything.
I'm just for example I'm selecting see now these that pop
up is not coming why because. Can group can contain at one
normal user, normal pxs users or LDAP groups. OK if it is. For
example in the setting same settings icon that same LDAP
enforcement doggle button was in disable mode means update in Add
group. Simply I was giving some project
area Anusha name now AFC. See now that pop up validation
is not coming and we can able to update I mean create our update
why because that is in disable mode so group can contains both.
So now for this automation test, test validation, regression
project area. These both these group contains
3 users right that 3 users and my name should get all these
process roles. Same process again we can able to remove. If
you archive that group all the process role should get removed
from the project area. Everything process again same.
But only difference is we can able to add normal pxs user and
as well as LDAP groups in a single group. Automation test validation. If I
go to project area, active project area Anusha my name is
coming Arun Jain, Satya, Vikas. May be these names and all
already there in the. Project area itself we didn't
create Elm application might be while creating this project area
or something someone has given that process roles and someone
has added this. So it is not our thing to do. But through Pxs
application we can able to add some process roles to the
persons. Can we can you we continue tomorrow or else. Up to now is it okay, yeah we
can because still we have the create users and archive users
these also I cannot tell you in the UI part. I can tell you
verbally archive and these create users part and we have
APIs, it will take another half an hour. Can we schedule
tomorrow? Yeah we can. Anybody has any
issue with that? Yes please suggest if I will ask, OK we
